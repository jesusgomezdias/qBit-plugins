qBittorrent Search plugins
==========================

[bakabt.me](https://bakabt.me) is a site that specialises in high-quality,
well-seeded and complete anime-related materials.

[linuxtracker](http://linuxtracker.org) is a tracker for linux torrents,
including distro .iso files and software tarballs.

[Nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si) is a drop-in replacements for the now
removed NyaaTorrents.

Installation
------------

### Linuxtracker
Simply download the [plugin file](engines/linuxtracker.py) or copy the
following [link](https://github.com/MadeOfMagicAndWires/qBit-plugins/raw/main/engines/linuxtracker.py).

After you've done this you can add this plugin to qBittorrent by going:

<kbd>Search tab</kbd> ðŸ¡ª <kbd>Search Plugins</kbd> ðŸ¡ª <kbd>Install a new one</kbd>
<kbd>Local File</kbd> then select the plugin file
 **or**
<kbd>Web Link</kbd> then insert the link you copied.

Or by manually copying the `bakabt.py` to the following location:
  * Linux: `~/.local/share/data/qBittorrent/nova/engines/linuxtracker.py`
  * Mac: ``~/Library/Application Support/qBittorrent/nova/engines/linuxtracker.py`
  * Windows: `C:\Documents and Settings\username\Local Settings\Application Data\qBittorrent\nova\engines\linuxtracker.py`

### Nyaa.si
Take [this](https://github.com/MadeOfMagicAndWires/qBit-plugins/raw/main/engines/nyaasi.py)
file and follow the steps above.

#### Downloading .torrent files instead of magnet links
This requires an extra step in that you have to manually edit the
[nyaa.si](engines/nyaasi.py) file before (or after) installing it using
qBittorrent.

The plugin defaults to using magnet links, but in order to download torrent
files instead you can edit line **41**:

```python
    # Whether to use magnet links or download torrent files ###################
    #
    # Set to 'True' to use magnet links, or 'False' to use torrent files
    use_magent_links = True
    #
    ###########################################################################
```

by setting the `use_magnet_links` variable to `False`
(the capitalisation matters here) instead, search results will link to torrent
files going forward. Once you've installed any version >=1.2
any changes to this setting should take immediate effect.

These steps will have to be repeated every time you update the plugin, either
manually or through qBittorrent.

### BakaBT
Because BakaBT requires your login info, this plugin requires a bit more work than most.

1. Firstly you'll need an ~~[account](https://bakabt.me/signup.php)~~
   (Admission currently closed)
2. Then you need to put your login information directly into the [plugin file](engines/bakabt.py):

You can do this by editing these specific lines (lineno. 52:53).
```python
    # Login information ######################################################
    #
    # SET THESE VALUES!!
    #
    username = "username"
    password = "password"
    ##########################################################################
    ...
```
Now replace the "username" and "password" with *your* username and password, surrounded by quotation marks.
So if your username is `foobar` and your `password` is bazqux these lines should read:
```python
    ...
    # SET THESE VALUES
    #
    username = "foobar"
    password = "bazqux"
    ...
```
After this is done you can follow the same steps as with the other plugins.

F.A.Q
-----

1. **This plugin doesn't require my torrent pass, does this plugin provide personalized torrents?**

  Because the plugin logs you in for every search, this means that the torrent files you open using it are your
  personal ones. It's effectively no different than if you'd visit the site and download the torrent manually.
